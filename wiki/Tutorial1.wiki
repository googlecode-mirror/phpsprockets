==Hello world==

Let's start with a div:

{{{
require_once 'phpSprockets/Sprocket.php';

$my_first_sprocket = new Sprocket('div');
}}}

And let's *give it an attribute*, such as a CSS class:

{{{
$my_first_sprocket->class = 'some_css_class';
}}}

==Add some tags to the div==

{{{
$my_first_sprocket->h1( "Hello world" );
$my_first_sprocket->p( "This is the beginning of something really cool!" );
}}}

We can add any tag we like, even ones that don't exist in HTML.

==Output the HTML==

{{{
echo $my_first_sprocket->render();
}}}
