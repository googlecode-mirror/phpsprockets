Sprocket factories are great for producing code without writing the same thing over and over. A factory is a collection of static functions.

==Create a form using Sprocket_Forms==

{{{
$my_form = Sprocket_Forms::Form( 'form_name' );
}}}
You should consult the factory documentation or code to see what arguments are needed.

==Add some form elements==

!Sprocket_Forms has a whole bunch of functions to make common and not-so-common form elements. When we make an element, we just add it to the form we made:

{{{
$name_input = Sprocket_Forms( 'name' );
$my_form->add( $name_input );
}}}
