Sprocket factories are great for producing code without writing the same thing over and over. A factory is a collection of static functions.

==Create a form using Sprocket_Forms==

{{{
$my_form = Sprocket_Forms::Form( 'form_name' );
}}}
You should consult the factory documentation or code to see what arguments are needed.

==Add some form elements==

!Sprocket_Forms has a whole bunch of functions to make common and not-so-common form elements. When we make an element, we just add it to the form we made:

{{{
$name_input = Sprocket_Forms::textInput( 'name' );
$my_form->add( $name_input );

$password_input = Sprocket_Forms::passwordInput( 'pswd' );
$my_form->add( $password_input );
}}}


==Add a Select==

!Sprocket_Forms lets you define a select using an associative array:

{{{
$options = array( 
              'cc' => "Credit card",
              'gc' => "Gift card",
              'gb' => "Gold bullion" );

$payment_menu = Sprocket_Forms::SelectInput( 'payment', $options );
$my_form->add( $payment_menu );
}}}

_Look how clean that code is compared to most PHP Select routines !_
