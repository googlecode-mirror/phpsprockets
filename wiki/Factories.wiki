==What is a Sprocket factory?==

A Sprocket factory is a class containing static functions that generate sprockets. For example, an image factory might have a function like this:

{{{
Sprocket_Image::Image( $image_src, $width, $height, $alt_text );
}}}

Which would return a single Sprocket that would render an <img /> tag. A more complex example might be a factory making image links:

{{{
Sprocket_Image::ImageLink( $href, $src, $width, $height, $alt_text )
}}}

Which would return a Sprocket that would render an img tag nested within an anchor tag.

==Available factories==

The phpSprockets library currently contains the following factories:

  * *Sprocket_Forms*: HTML form and form element factory

Since the Sprockets code is simple and stable, most development of this library will be in the form of new factories. You are encouraged to submit factories to the library.
